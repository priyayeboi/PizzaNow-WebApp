                About Us
            </div>
            <h2 id="about">PizzaNow uses only the freshest, best quality ingredients mostly sourced from Italy for our authentic thin-crusted pizzas, created using first-press, high quality extra virgin olive oil. Our strong culinary team that manages the restaurant chain endeavours to offer a true Italian experience to the finest detail.
            <br>
            <br>
			Using only traditional methods of baking pizzas in specially-sourced stone ovens, PizzaNow makes its own pizza dough in-house daily. We believe in serving food with integrity, which is why we fly our tomatoes, mushrooms and many of our key ingredients from Italy. 
			<br>
            <br>
			Furthermore, our chefs are always looking at ways to please our customers with new and exciting pizza dough flavours, sauces and toppings, and are constantly experimenting with ways to add an extra dimension to the wide range of varieties offered.
